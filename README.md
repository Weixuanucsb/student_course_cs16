# Code from the review session on March 15, 2019

The files in this repo implement two structs: one for a `Student`, which is a "node" in our list, and one for a `Course`, which is out linked list that simulates a course roster.

Each set of functions contains a test program that demostrates and verifies the correctness of the intended functionality.
